# NeuralComputing

Pair Project Coursework for Neural Computing course @City, University of London.
Worked using MATLAB with my coursemate Andrew Gibbs-Bravo, in this article we deliver a comparison between a feedforward Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Suppor Vector Machines (SVM) applied to an Image Classification task (CIFAR-10 dataset).
Hyperparameters were varied (gridsearched) in the training phase to achieve the best possible performance for each model, whose classification rate was compared on the hold out test sample using Confusion Matrices.
